# Simple Blockchain Simulation in Java

## Overview
This is a basic blockchain simulation implemented in Java. It demonstrates core blockchain features like block creation, hashing, proof-of-work, and tamper detection.

## Features
- ✅ Implements a blockchain with linked blocks.
- ✅ Uses SHA-256 for secure hashing.
- ✅ Supports mining with Proof-of-Work (difficulty adjustable).
- ✅ Validates blockchain integrity.
- ✅ Detects tampering when data is modified.

## Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
- Git installed for version control.
